The Domains
	The world in Tranquil is divided into four main domains:
		Earth: the physical domain - the world that we know and experience
		Heaven: the domain of order and control, harboring the Council of Angels
		Hell: the domain of chaos and creativity, home to the Circle of Demons
		Tranquil: the domain of dreams that connect the other domains
The four seals
	The Seal of Order
		Connecting the Heaven to Tranquil, the Seal of Order keeps God from fully stripping human kind from freedom of thought by enforcing absolute morality.  
	The Seal of Chaos
		Connecting the Heaven to Tranquil, the Seal of Chaos keeps the Devil from freely altering the physical reality of Earth by the force of creativity. 
	The Seal of Death
		Connecting the Earth to Tranquil, the Seal of Death strips humankind from its former mortality, ensuring that the souls of the demised are trapped in Heaven, Hell or Tranquil.
	The Seal of Tranquil
		Tethered between the realms of Heaven, Hell and Earth is the Beast of Tranquil, the manifestation of discord caused by the Rupture. Chained between the domains, the Beast rests eternally.
