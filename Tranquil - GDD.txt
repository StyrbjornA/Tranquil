Tranquil - Game Design Document

Gameplay concept
Tranquil is a metroidvania exploration platformer with a semi open world approach, where collectible power ups expand the number of areas that can be reached.

The story will be told in a non intrusive way, through optional dialogue and interactive objects (signs etc.).

Graphical style
Tranquil works with a low res (240 x 160 pixels), two color design. The colors can be changed depending on the theme of an area (forest, lava, ice etc.). 

Audio
Tranquil relies on atmospheric sounds and a minimalistic soundtrack, with discernible music only during key encounters and events.
