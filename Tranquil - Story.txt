TRANQUIL - STORY
	Main Story
		A middle school girl named Sophia commits suicice, ends up in the Limbo world of Tranquil and explores her memory to learn about the cause of her demise. Eventually she finds out that she is but a pawn in a much bigger scheme that will bring about a battle between Heaven and Hell and the destruction of Earth. 
	Game World
		The world in Tranquil is divided into four main domains:
			Earth: the physical domain - the world that we know and experience
			Heaven: the domain of order and control, harboring the Council of Angels
			Hell: the domain of chaos and creativity, home to the Circle of Demons
			Tranquil: the domain of dreams that connect the other domains

		In the beginning of time there was the Domain of Creation, brought about by The Creator. It's pinnacle was the creation of mankind, an advanced species that had much in common with it's maker, having near unlimited power the mold the world to its liking. 

		This planted a seed of conflict within The Creator. The desire to remain in power, to have undisputed control over creation, was contrasted by the drive to let mankind flourish with unbound creativity. Thus The Creator and the world was split into manifestations of the incompatible urges that could no longer be contained within one, single mind. God became the Lord of the Domain of Heaven, and the Devil became the Lord of the Domain of Hell. Mankind was banished to the physically restrained domain of Earth, losing its immortality, its powers and being forever governed by the conflicting influences of order and chaos. A fourth domain, Tranquil, was formed, binding the three domains together.
	Plot
		The Devil learns that while both himself and God are unable to control humans on Earth directly, human dreams take place in Tranquil, a domain that is linked to both Heaven and Hell. Thus, the Devil manipulates a human child in her dreams into following her dreams, which will eventually lead her to commit suicide. Children, unlike adults, are not yet attunted to either order or chaos, and will therefore not end up in Heaven or Hell when they die. Instead their souls are trapped in the Garden of Tranquil without ever being subject to judgement. 

		The girl Sophia however is already influenced by the Devil, and can traverse Tranquil in its entirety. Convinced that human suffering is caused by the laws of order put forth by God, her goal is to breach the seals between Tranquil, Heaven, Hell and Earth. The destruction of the three seals, she thought, would elevate humanity to its former state of power and freedom, the abscence of which was the cause of her death in the first place.
